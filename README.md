# ATM-Application
**Overview**

This project is a simple ATM system implemented in Python, simulating basic ATM functionalities such as account creation, authentication, deposits, withdrawals, balance checking, and password management. The system supports both user and admin accounts, with specific privileges and restrictions.

**Features**

**User Features:**

1. Account Creation: Admin can create accounts for users with an initial balance.

2. Authentication: Users can log in with their user ID and password.

3. Deposit: Users can deposit a specified amount using defined denominations.

4. Withdraw: Users can withdraw a specified amount using defined denominations.

5. Check Balance: Users can view their current account balance.

6. Change Password: Users can change their account password.

**Admin Features:**

1. Admin Authentication: Admin can log in with the admin password.

2. View All Users: Admin can view a list of all user accounts, including their balances and lock status.

3. Warning Message: The system displays a warning if the total balance across all accounts is less than â‚¹75,000.

**Security Features:**

1. Account Locking: Accounts are locked after three unsuccessful login attempts.

2. Admin Locking: The admin account is locked after three unsuccessful login attempts.
